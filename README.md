# patient-priority-with-AHP
The hierarchical analysis method is proposed in decision-making models with multiple objectives. The basis of using this method is to rely on the data and opinions of experts in the field under investigation. In the data of the treatment center, 4 types of diseases and medical problems have been reported for patients, and here we are trying to find the importance of each of these 4 cases.
In this method, the problem is divided into several main levels, the first level is the goal, the second level is the criteria, and the third level is the alternatives. Of course, each level can be divided into a number of sub-levels. In our case, the aim of the study is to determine the priority of patients in the treatment center. Regarding the criteria, as mentioned earlier, our criteria are:
 The degree of inclusiveness among patients
 The impact on patient waiting time
 How dangerous the disease is 
Regarding the alternatives, in our problem, each of those 4 types of diseases and medical problems is an alternative. Therefore, the alternatives can be summarized as follows:
 Having blood pressure
 Having diabetes
 Having a disability 
 Having an addiction to alcoholic beverages
